Our group had trouble completing the project on time because of stress and physical illness. one of group member william had a fever for a few days which resulted in his inability to start project on time. Further more, getMap rasterer and kdtree closest was harder to debug than we had expected, taking 2 days of the total project time. specifically, we ran into problems with runtime and null pointer exceptions. Furthermore we were under alot of academic and personal stress. Therefore we request to take one extra day for project.
